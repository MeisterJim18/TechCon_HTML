      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>We are students from the Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences. In 2012, we witnessed the rise of smartphones with models like the iPhone, Samsung Galaxy, and Windows Phone. We started as a group of four tech enthusiasts, and soon realized many others shared our passion. Two years later, our group grew to 50 participants, then 100, and by 2023, we reached over 300 attendees.</p>
